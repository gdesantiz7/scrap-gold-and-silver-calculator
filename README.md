# Scrap Gold and Silver Calculator
Many people find difficulty in determining the price of their scrap gold or silver.  This can lead to great uncertainty when trying to sell.  The primary goal of this application is to allow users to get a fair value for their gold or silver so that they can properly examine offers.

This calculator outputs a value of United States Dollars (USD) given a weight and purity of gold or silver.  It does not factor in intrinsic value that may apply to rare collectibles and coins or branded jewelry.  The value of the gold or silver is determined by using the current spot price of gold or silver per troy ounce in the market.  For the most accurate results, please update the spot price for the desired precious metal prior to running the calculator.

## Using the Gold and Silver Calculator
Under the Output section, type gold_silver_calculator().  Hold shift and press enter to run the calculator.

## Disclaimer
Trading and investing in cryptocurrencies (also called digital or virtual currencies, crypto assets, altcoins and so on) involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor.  The valuation of cryptocurrencies and futures may fluctuate, and, as a result, you may lose more than your original investment.  The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains.

If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your account.
